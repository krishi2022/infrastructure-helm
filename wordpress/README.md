## References:

* [Bitnami WordPress](https://bitnami.com/stack/wordpress/helm) documentation.

## Important TIP

As you debug, you may need to install and uninstall the chart a few times until things are working. __Use a unique release name for each attempt__ or data stored in the persistent volume claim from the previous attempt may cause issues. 

## Instructions

- [ ] Open a terminal navigate to the `wordpress` directory (the one with this file.)
- [ ] Populate the [values.yaml](values.yaml) file with custom values for these parameters:

    | Key | Value |
    |-----|-------|
    | wordpressUsername | supply your *first name* in all lower case (i.e. `jeff`) |
    | wordpressPassword | `T0p$3cr3t`
    | wordpressEmail | your Columbus State student email address |
    | wordpressFirstName | Your first name (i.e. `Jeff`) |
    | wordpressLastName | Your last name (i.e. `Anderson`) |
    | wordpressBlogName | Give it a name unique to your (i.e. `Jeff's Blog`) or something more fun and creative |
    | service.type | NodePort |
    | service.nodePorts.http | 30080 |
    | service.nodePorts.https | 30443 |

- [ ] Using the [helm install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/) command, install the chart using the custom values in the `values.yaml` file.

- [ ] Copy the command you used, and the output generated and paste it below:

```
paste the command and output here
```

- [ ] Using `minikube service list`, get the URL to your application. 

- [ ] Open the URL in your browser and make sure it's working.

- [ ] From a terminal running in this directory, overwrite [my-manifest.txt](my-manifest.txt) with the contents generated by this command: `helm get manifest *Your-Release-Name-Here* > my-manifest.txt`.

- [ ] Use the [helm uninstall](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) command to uninstall your chart.

- [ ] Copy the command you used, and the output generated and paste it below:
